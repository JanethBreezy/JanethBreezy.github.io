          <p>A summary of the Essex Market history(Based on the Essex Market Website)</p>
          <h>The Essex Market used to be a hub for independent pushcart peddlers. The people in those pushcarts sold a
          lot of vegetables and other such that people started to buy off from them.
          However it got extremely overcrowded in that particular area that they had to create a public indoor market,
          such as the Essex Market.
          Soon, the Puerto Rican immigrants arrived to the Lower East Side due to the new migration wave.
          As time goes by many years later,the Essex Market became a development project. Which became a success!
          To this day you can visit the market in the Lower East Side.</h>

           A lot of women were mostly doing the shopping for their kids since their husbands were fighting and preparing to
           fight in WWII (Interesting fact). This was a rough time for both women and men, they had to deal with a lot of
           conflict in order to protect what they needed to protect.

          <p>This image shows the Lower East Side back in the old days. You probably recognize the building where the pizza shop is taken place.
          The Lower East Side was filled with a lot of immigrants who migrated, in order to sustain a great life. However most immigrants
          had to be in the bottom half of Manhattan because of New York City getting all changed up at upper Manhattan (Central Park).</p>
